- check homework
- square, distance
- currying:
  - in Haskell, all function are curried by default
  - sometimes we say, a function is "partially applied"
- operators:
  - infixity, R L
  - precedence
  - unary operators: (-)
- pattern matching:
  - (&&), (||), not
  - wildcard pattern
  - divide (match on 0)
- tuples:
  - distance
  - isOnSameLine
  - canConstructTriangle
where:
  - reduce redundancy
  - introduce helper functions
